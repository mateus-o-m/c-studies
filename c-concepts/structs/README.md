\# Struct: user-defined data type, it groups related variables (known as members) of different data types (e.g. int, float, char, etc), even other structs

\# declaration:

struct struct\_name {

&nbsp;	//members

};

\# variables assignment:

struct struct\_name var1;

struct sctruc\_name var2;

\# declaration using typedef:

typedef struct {

&nbsp;	//members

} struct\_name;

\# variables assignment:

struct\_name var3;

struct\_name var4;
